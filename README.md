# CRISPR-Repair
A pipeline to study various DNA repair mechanism after creating double stand break 

CRISPR-Repair is a software pipeline for the analysis of Double strand DNA breaks created by targeted CRISPR-Cas9 and later repaired by various repair pathway genes. After the double strand break cells are allowed to grow and repair the cut. Specific primers amplify the targeted region and paired end high throughput sequencing is used to sequence each of the amplicon.  In ideal condition breaks are supposed to be repaired perfectly (without any mutation compared to WT at the ligation junction) however in the real situation this is not true. A significant fraction of times the cut site is chewed by repair or accessory protein before ligation and thus creates a deletion compared to WT sequence. The length of the deletion varies from clone to clone and most often a micro-homology of 2-15 bases long has been observed at the ligation junction. The ligation happens in such a way that one unit of repeat sequence is part of ligation junction where as second repeat unit get digested before ligation. CRISPR-Repair allows a user to quantitate the break repaired perfectly (sequence observed as WT) and repair with error that is quantitated as extent of deletion (number of base pairs deletion at the junction of repair). Finally the program identify if there is any micro homology at the ligation junction and their homology motif.
